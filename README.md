This repository was created for the DSB 2021 bike traffic prediction challenge. 
It was part of the RAMP project (ramp.studio), which offers different data challenges in the area of machine learning.

The goal was to best predict the cyclist traffic in Paris using public data.

The team consisted of Simon Mack and Adrian Tan (github.com/acktan)
